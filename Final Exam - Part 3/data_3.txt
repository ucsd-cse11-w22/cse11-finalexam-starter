Finding the red rose in the mailbox was a pleasant 
surprise for Sarah. She didn't have a boyfriend or know of anyone who was interested in her as anything more than a friend. There wasn't even a note 
attached to it. Although it was a complete mystery, it still made her heart jump and race a 
little more than usual. She wished that she could simply accept the gesture and be content knowing someone had given it to her, 
but that wasn't the way Sarah did things. Now it was time to do a little detective work and try to figure who had actually left 
the red rose.
